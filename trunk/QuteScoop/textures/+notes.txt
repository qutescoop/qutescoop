Textures:
You can add textures here in all supported formats that get reported in View/Debug Log when opening Preferences.
Depending on your graphics card, it might be necessary that width and height are a power of 2 (1024, 2048, 4096...) pixels.
The Preferences Dialog will let you choose between all available textures.
The debug log will tell you if there was an error loading the texture.
