wanted (not yet implemented):
* control thread priority (QS sometimes uses a lot of CPU for updates; we should be able to run at lower priority)

last commit Changelog (1.0.3 alpha 9):

changed
* bookings get not downloaded if they are not needed (code change, hopefully works in the end...)
* disabled View/Show All Routes, this often produced a program hang, and I do not think it is important.
* Make "save screenshots" selection persistent
* re-organization of directory structure (remove ./gui and put files to ./src)

added
* map special approaches: EDBB -> EDDI, NY -> KLGA
* import/export settings from/to a .ini file - allows transfer of settings between computers.

QuteScoop Changelog - Version 1.0.2 - 1.0.3 alpha 8

REMARKS:
* Please provide feedback how you like the ToolBoxes or if we should change to Tabs (in List Clients and Plan Flight)
* We still need a way to map EDBB_APP -> EDDB + EDDT and so on
* Next big thing: Replay mode (replay downloaded Whazzups, save a picture of each to allow creating videos from events et al)

changed:
* Markus' great code to identify ATC sectors above an airport!
* Symbol for Delivery
* Zoom accelerated if mouse wheel driver supports it, zoom factor configurable
* Increased max. possible value for shown labels (in preferences)
* Render dashed lines in front of/behind plane also in flightplan Plot mode
* Replace Messageboxes by Statusbar-Messages to allow a less intrusive and smoother user experience that does not need any interaction - thought for running whole nights

added:
* Show Network (and Voice for VATSIM) Servers and ping them
* Respect the update interval that the Whazzup server transmits
* Show ATC bookings in list (VATSIM only so far)
* Do Time Warping: Jump to a date and time and see the expected ATC coverage AND traffic situation
    * See prefiled flights in arrival and departure lists and in Time Warp on the map as faked real pilots
    * Allow "real time"-prediction
    * Add Controllers to prediction that have "ONLINE UNTIL 1234Z" et al in their Controller Info (ATIS)
* List, search and filter all connected clients and show distance from present position: look for supervisors etc.
* Remember / recall Multiple Map Positions
* Save all downloaded data in "./downloaded" - to be used in replay mode (not yet implemented)
* Show OpenGL debug messages and be able to set OpenGL parameters through own config file
* Show inactive airports when zoomed in (switchable via Menu)
* Filter airport traffic to only show traffic in the vicinity of airport (configurable)
* Show rings of airport congestion around airports (configurable)
* Show _CTR and _FSS stations as ATC in Airport Information, if their sector boundaries are somewhat near to the airport (experimental)
* Doubleclick to center map, right or left drag to pan
* Key commands for pan and zoom
* Remember and recall 7 Map Positions
* Request routes from route providers. So far only vroute is integrated, but all major route databases have been asked (SimRoutes, asalink, VATroute, IVAO-DB).
    * Requested or manually enterred routes can be plotted onto the map using the free XPlane-NavDatabase
* Allow to disable the front/behind part of plotted routes
* Show flight delay as difference from filed ETA to calculated ETA
* Zoom with butons on the status bar (requested by tablet PC user)
* Use "timeout bar" to select first item on map click in crowded areas
* Show _DEL in Airport Information
* Get METAR direct from Airport Information
* See ToolTips on most buttons and objects

fixed:
* Facilitytype for ATIS (VATSIM)
* Restore Docks correctly on window minimize/restore
* Allow to disable border lines by setting strength to 0px
* Show map labels of busy airports in favor of less busier ones
* Labels are less conservative in decluttering and use the screen better
* Show _FSS stations (by faking the facilityType which is not reported correctly in WhazzUp data for VATSIM)
* Preferences dialog fits on a 1280x800 screen
* Put data location in the program path (./data), not /usr/share on Unix, may be overridden through option general/dataDirectory as before
* Set Zoom In/Out to CTRL+/- as F11 got obscured on Linux and was not applicable on Mac as well

QuteScoop Changelog - Version 1.0.2

* Fixed a VATSIM display bug introduced by a new blank line. Patch was
  submitted by Jonas Eberle - thanks!
