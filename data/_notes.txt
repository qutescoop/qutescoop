airports.dat
------

This file contains ICAO code, name, city, country and location of airports.
See the comment in the file for the file structure.


------
controllerAirportsMapping.dat
------

By default airports are assigned to controllers by their common prefix (= ICAO-code).
This file allows to add additional airports to a controller. See the comment in the
file for how is works.

------
coastline.dat
------

These are the world coastline (continents, islands, large lakes etc) and
country borders, drawn as closed polygons on the globe. Each line contains
either a pair of decimal latitude and longitude values separated by a colon, or
the 'end' word. Lines are drawn between subsequent lat-lon pairs. The 'end'
word means the beginning of a new polygon. At the end, a line is drawn to the
beginning to close the polygon.

The current files are based on World Data Base II from the USGS Coastline
Extractor - http://rimmer.ngdc.noaa.gov/coast/ and adapted: some very fine
reolution (<2 NM from each other) have been striped and lines arranged to be
closed polygons for faster drawing.

countries.dat
------

Used to display long / short country names.
See the comment in the file for the file structure.

------
firlist.dat
------

This contains definitions of stations that have polygon sector areas
(currently CTR+FSS).

An example of a row from this file:

LRBB:Bucharest:RO:45.9:25.6:186[:CTR]

LRBB      - controller login prefix. Can contain _ (e.g. LRBB_N)
Bucharest - name of the sector
RO        - [UNUSED] ISO code of the country where this airspace is
            [deprecated, not used in QuteScoop any more]
45.3      - [UNUSED] position of the label - decimal latitude (north is positive,
            south is negative) [deprecated, not used in QuteScoop any more]
25.6      - [UNUSED] position of the label - decimal longitude (east is positive,
            west is negative) [deprecated, not used in QuteScoop any more]
186       - Sector ID. See firdisplay.dat.
CTR (optional) - controller login suffix(es): when given, is only assigned to 
            controller logins with that suffix. You can give multiple, 
            separated by space (CTR FSS).

firdisplay.dat
------

This contains the shapes of sectors, constructed of points described as
lat-lon pairs. The connection between firlist.dat and firdisplay.dat is made
through the Sector IDs. The ID is mentioned at the beginning of each
sector. For example:

Blocks of sector descriptions, each starting with
DISPLAY_LIST_<Sector ID> - the sector ID can not contain _, : or space but 
                           anything else is valid.

For example:

DISPLAY_LIST_186
43.75:28.6
43.83:28
43.99:27.95
(etc)

To create new shapes, you can use
the sconv.exe in from Dolomynum \tools that can convert sector files of ATC
clients (IvAc, ASRC, VRC, ProController), or Servinfo / IvAe data files to
Dolomynum format. To view the existing (or newly created) airspaces on the
globe, use sectorview.exe from Dolomynum \tools.

firdisplay.sup
[unused since QuteScoop v2.5.0]

This has historically been used to provide VATSIM-specific changes to 
firlist.dat.


------
airlines.dat
------

The file structure is the same that EuroScope uses in its ICAO_Airlines.txt.

It is tab(!)-separated.

ICAO Code 	Airline Name	Callsing	Country

Example:
AAA	Ansett Australia	ANSETT	Australia

ICAO Code:		AAA
Airline Name:	Ansett Australia
Callsign:		"ANSETT"
Country:		Australia
