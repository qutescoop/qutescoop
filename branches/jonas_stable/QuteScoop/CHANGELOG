QuteScoop Changelog - Version 1.0.3 jonas alpha
changed:
* Zoom accelerated if mouse wheel driver supports it, zoom factor configurable
* Increased max. value for shown labels (in preferences)
* Render dashed lines in front of/behind plane also in flightplan Plot mode

added:
* Show ATC bookings in list (VATSIM only so far)
* Time Warping: Jump to a date and time and see the expected ATC coverage AND traffic situation
* See prefiled flights in arrival and departure lists and in Time Warp on the map as faked real pilots
* Multiple Map Positions can be remembered / recalled
* OpenGL debug messages and ability to set OpenGL parameters through own config file
* Show inactive airports when zoomed in
* Filter airport traffic to only show traffic in the vicinity of airport (configurable)
* Show rings of airport congestion around airports (configurable)
* Show _CTR and _FSS stations as ATC in Airport Information, if their sector boundaries are somewhat near to the airport (experimental)
* Doubleclick to center map, right or left drag to pan
* Key commands for pan and zoom
* Remember and recall 7 Map Positions
* Request routes from route providers. So far only vroute is integrated, 
  but we asked all major route databases to join us
* Show _FSS stations by faking the facilityType which is not reported correctly in WhazzUp data
* Show delay as difference from filed arrival time to calculated ETA
* Zoom butons on the status bar (requested by tablet PC user)
* Use timeout to select first item in ClientSelection

fixed:  
* Docks restore correctly on window minimize/restore
* Allow to disable border lines by setting strength to 0px
* Always show map label of a busy airport in favor to a less busy one
* Labels are less conservative in decluttering and use the screen better
* Preferences dialog fits on a 1280x800 screen
* Data location on Unix/Linux: standard is now in the program path (./data), not /usr/share, may be overridden through option general/dataDirectory as before
* Set Zoom In/Out to CTRL+/- as F11 got obscured on Linux and was not applicable on Mac as well
* Show _DEL in Airport Information
