QuteScoop Changelog - Version 1.0.3 jonas alpha
changed:
* Zoom accelerated if mouse wheel driver supports it

added:
* Show ATC bookings in list (VATSIM only so far)
* Time Warping: Jump to a time and see the expected ATC coverage. Planned:
  See also traffic situation
* OpenGL debug messages + ability to set OpenGL parameters through own config file
* Show inactive airports, they have their own zoom treshold for dot and label
* Filter airport traffic to only show traffic in the vicinity of airport
* Show rings of airport congestion around airports 
* Doubleclick to center map, right or left click to pan
* Request routes from route providers. So far only vroute is integrated, 
  but we asked all other major route databases to join us
* Show _FSS stations by faking the facilityType which is not reported correctly in WhazzUp data

fixed:  
* Docks restore correctly on window minimize/restore
* Allow to disable border lines by setting strength to 0
* OpenGL labels rendering: big airports will draw over smaller ones, 
  labels are less conservative in decluttering (allow a bit of overlap on the edges) 

... WIP
