See the QuteScoop-Wiki <http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/qutescoop> for
general project status and planned features.

Version 2.1.2
 added:
  * linker includes libGLU on UNIX. Should make compiling out of the
    box possible again (Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with libgl1-mesa-dev).
  * setting 'simple labels' greatly improves performance on low-end graphic cards.
    It disables collision-checking between labels and thus relieves us from
    transferring lat/lon- to x/y-coordinates. Drawback is that labels will
    draw over each other and won't be centered with its objects. Enabled by default.
  * TTG/online until - information in List Clients
 changed:
  * OpenGL quality settings to default.
 fixed:
  * VATRoute route provider: Our dear friend lost his domain michael-nagler.de
    where the parsing webservice was hosted. Put the parsing in QuteScoop.

 *upperwind direction
 *join Teamspeakchannel for IVAO(Whazzup was changed)

Version 2.0rc19
added:
 *function to chose custom color for the wind flags
 *save position, state and geometry from all dialogs and windows
 
Version 2.0rc18

 *Pilotlabels at airports aren't displayed

Version 2.0rc17
fixed:
 *IVAO Whazzupversion (now 5)
 *toggle all sectors 
added:
 *uppperwind visualisation

Version 2.0rc16
 changed:
 *zooming via rectagle selcting only by selcting more than 60pix

Version 2.0rc15
 fixed:
*OnScreenSetting now working with linux

Version 2.0rc14
 changed:
* airlinesearch optimized
* OnScreenttings optimized
added:
* toggle pilot labels
* Tooltip for airlinefield(PilotsDeatailDialog): ICAO airline(Source: data/airline.dat)

Version 2.0rc13
 fixed:
* closing TimeWrap Widget bug
 changed:
* qoted out the pilot ratings (not supported yet by servers)
 added:
* airlinedatabase (airline.dat) Source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_codes-All
  airlines can be searched in the SearchDialog and displayed in the Pilots Dialog
* On Screen Settings Added
  quick access for the displaysettings(toggle Routes, Sectors, ...)

Version 2.0rc12:
 changed:
* resize logic of pilots and controller details.
 added:
* map labels choose secondary positions if their preferred location is already
  taken. This results in more labels shown.
* selection box for multiple clients near mouse cursor resizes dynamically.
* buttton to open airport details for airport controllers.
* option "use selection rectangle". If switched off, left mouse button is used
  for globe panning, too.

Version 2.0rc11:
 fixed:
* internal code refactoring: Fixed memory holes and removed (hopefully)
  unnecessary checks. If you experience stability problems, please report.
 changed:
* removed the exit animation as it proved to be disturbing ;)
 added:
* if no sector data of a CTR/FSS-controller is available, a simple circle
  around his main visibility center with half his reported visibility range is
  drawn (looks ugly, so if you see such thing, please help to provide sector
  data).
* pilot tooltips include DEP-DEST.
* fade Earth to space (using OpenGL fog function).
* allow to disable all texts by setting their color-alpha to 0 in the Preferences
  dialog.
* option to use ONLY downloaded Whazzups when in Warp-mode (no prediction at
  all, useful for replaying and seeing only what really happened)
* (internal) GUI message (statusbar text and progressbar) system changed from
  the ground up to have a unified way for all classes to throw messages of
  different types onto the user. As a user, you may notify that temporary
  messages show and disappear after some seconds now. This was done with
  extendability in mind. (not yet ready and far from perfect)

Version 2.0rc10:
 fixed:
* faster load times of preferences dialog through lazy-loading of iconized
  textures (it is still prone to use large amounts of memory if you have
  huge textures in the texture folder as they get scaled on-the-fly and thus
  need to be completely loaded).
 changed:
* updated IVAO-ratings.
* ultimately appealing handling of plotted routes (transparently reflected in
  airport and pilot dialogs).
* functions for saving/restoring window statii and positions (problems
  on Mac OS where reported - please try if this works).
 added:
* support for ARINC424 geographic waypoints (3030N, 30N30 etc.) and some weird
  other (incorrect) formats like 30N20W, 30/20, 3000N 02000W that are used by
  unknowledgable ocean-crossers...
* increased overall error tolerance in route resolvement.
* show resolved route in Pilot details.
* option to show route waypoints (for planned routes, too) on the map
  (including frequencies of navaids).
* all lines and dots can be disabled by setting their strength to 0.

Version 2.0rc9:
 fixed:
* size of one texture.
 changed:
* some default values to adapt better to lighting.
 added:
* icons of textures in Preferences dialog ;)

Version 2.0rc8:
 changed:
* lots of internal code refactoring with clarity and performance in mind.
* cleaner options for route plotting. Should now be easier to grasp. If you
  plot routes for one airport, new pilots to/from that airport will also
  be plotted (convenience function to monitor one airport, e.g. for air-
  port controllers)
* hold zoom buttons for continuous zoom.
 added:
* selectable screenshot method and -imageformat.
* zoom by dragging with middle mouse button (the best method ever I guess).
* allow to find controllers by their frequency or sector/FIR name (aka
  "London") when searching.
* show connected clients for servers and opened voice channels for voice
  servers.
* firlist.dat: NY_JBC (New York Oceanic).

Version 2.0rc7:
 fixed:
* online timespans corrected (UTC vs. local time bug) (regression).
* consistent Time Warp en-/disabling via menu, button or F8 key.
 changed:
* remove filtering of ATC stations with _T or _X in the middle (I don't
  know why it was added once...)
* remove automatic selection of objects on mouseclick in congested areas
  (removed progressbar from selection listbox)
* texture selection in Preferences dialog. You can add new textures, see
  textures/+notes.txt
* show name of sector in tooltip if we know it from firlist.dat.
* show sector label at least if we do not have sector data (CTR, FSS).
 added:
* selection rectangle allows zooming to a given area directly (left click
  and drag, right drag is panning as before).
* right click on zoom icons, press CTRL+0 or right double click on the map
  to reset zoom.
* direct access to Airport Details of departure/destination from Plan
  Route Dialog.
* you can enter your own routes in Plan Route Dialog to calculate distance
  and plot them.
* show all sector labels on "View/Display all Sectors" (support for sector
  file creators).
* some more icons from the great Crystal Project iconset from Everaldo
  Coelho, released under LGPL.

Version 2.0rc6:
 added:
* Textured Earth. Works good with lighting. You can exchange the texture to
  your liking (see ./textures/+notes.txt).

Version 2.0rc4:
 fixed:
* inactive airport labels get shown again. (regression since the
  faster update code from 2.0rc3)
 added:
* EARTH HAS SUN day/night SHADOW. Configurable through "Preferences" with
  various lighting options.
* new OpenGL-options in preferences to adjust performance on low-end
  machines.
* shutdown animation: fly away from spinning earth ;)
 changed:
* standard values for most settings adapted. New standard color scheme.
* increased visiblity distance for all objects. This might be configurable
  through "Preferences" if you ask for it ;)

Version 2.0rc3:
 fixed:
* crash after Metar download
 changed:
* MAJOR improvements on update times. Brought one important function in
  the Whazzup data updates down to ~10% of the CPU cycles needed before :)
* small improvements of "List clients"
 added:
* show an "hourglass" during CPU-intensive operations

Version 2.0rc2:
 fixed:
* crashs during route resolving ("Show all routes" etc.).
 changed:
* caching results of route calculations for performance.
* although I loved the GUI-responsiveness during long CPU-operations, I
  removed it because it tends to introduce instability.
 added:
* data-directories will now be checked on program start. If anything is
  wrong, QuteScoop can move files to the correct locations.
* more information on the compiling and running environment in the debug
  log browser.

Version 1.0.3 beta 5:
 changed:
* previous beta had some crashes now in the "data heavy" dialogs. Hopefully
  fixed now.
* Combined date+time fields in main window (Warp mode) + Booked ATC.
* Disabling warp via button works again.
* Time Warp and replaying from downloaded Whazzups works as expected
 added:
* LogBrowser also outputs readable version string.
* First signs of icons within QuteScoop. We need more ;)
* QuteScoop subdirectories can now be in %APPDATA% or besides the
  executable. The actual path gets determined on each program start. (See
  Debug Log Browser).
* installers are packaged with BitRock InstallBuilder Qt.

Version 1.0.3 beta 4:
 changed:
* preventing unnecessary calls to Main Window instance (I feel that this
  happened
  e.g. when opening BookedAtcDialog and caused major lags)
* underlying data model for BookedAtcModel and ListClientsDialog is less
  "automatic", thus preventing unnecessary filter operations. This results
  in a welcome speed-up in these "data-heavy" dialogs.
* restructured datafile downloader: added more feedback on the progress and
  if an error occurs.
* preparations to move to a new organisation of files which is necessary for
  packaging QuteScoop for Mac and Linux (/data needs to go to
  %ApplicationData%)
 added:
* First steps of GUI message handler controlling StatusBar, ProgressBar and
  MessageBoxes (not finished yet) [GuiMessage.h]:
  Its intention is to find a solution to the problem of concurring user
  messages, e.g. "There is a new Whazzup downloading, one notification of
  Bookings not available should be shown while one datafile from disk is
  not writable and if all that is over Whazzup status shall be displayed
  again."... This is not yet finished!

Version 1.0.3 beta 3:
 added:
* a Debug Log browser internally in the program + Debug output to "log.txt"
* allowing styleSheets - see under preferences ;)
 changed:
* reenabled the "Show all Routes" option - it tends to run infinitely
  though..
* use README in QuteScoop/About

Version 1.0.3 beta 2:
 added:
* included VATroute as route database

Version 1.0.3 beta 1:
 changed:
* found the performance bug that happened on each and every Whazzup update:)

Version 1.0.3 alpha 11:
 changed:
* brought back performance to the globe
 added:
* datafile update, at the moment running via svn /trunk/.../data

Version 1.0.3 alpha 9:
 changed:
* bookings get not downloaded if they are not needed (code change,
  hopefully works in the end...)
* disabled View/Show All Routes, this often produced a program hang, and I
  do not think it is important.
* Make "save screenshots" selection persistent
* re-organization of directory structure (remove ./gui and put files to
  ./src)
 added:
* map special approaches: EDBB -> EDDI, NY -> KLGA
* import/export settings from/to a .ini file - allows transfer of settings
  between computers.

Version 1.0.3 alpha 8
 changed:
* Markus' great code to identify ATC sectors above an airport!
* Symbol for delivery
* Zoom accelerated if mouse wheel driver supports it, zoom factor
  configurable
* Increased max. possible value for shown labels (in preferences)
* Render dashed lines in front of/behind plane also in flightplan plot mode
* Replace Messageboxes by statusbar-messages to allow a less intrusive and
  smoother user experience that does not need any interaction
 added:
* Show network (and voice for VATSIM) servers and ping them
* Respect the update interval that the Whazzup server transmits
* Show ATC bookings in list (VATSIM only so far)
* Do Time Warping: Jump to a date and time and see the expected ATC
  coverage AND traffic situation
    * See prefiled flights in arrival and departure lists and in Time Warp
      on the map as faked real pilots
    * Allow "real time"-prediction
    * Add Controllers to prediction that have "ONLINE UNTIL 1234Z" et al in
      their Controller Info (ATIS)
* List, search and filter all connected clients and show distance from
  present position: look for supervisors etc.
* Remember / recall Multiple Map Positions

  (not yet implemented)
* Show OpenGL debug messages and be able to set OpenGL parameters through
  own config file
* Show inactive airports when zoomed in (switchable via Menu)
* Filter airport traffic to only show traffic in the vicinity of airport
  (configurable)
* Show rings of airport congestion around airports (configurable)
* Doubleclick to center map, right or left drag to pan
* Key commands for pan and zoom
* Remember and recall 7 Map Positions
* Request routes from route providers. So far only vroute is integrated,
  but all major route databases have been asked (SimRoutes, asalink,
  VATroute, IVAO-DB).
    * Requested or manually enterred routes can be plotted onto the map
      using the free XPlane-NavDatabase
* Allow to disable the front/behind part of plotted routes
* Show flight delay as difference from filed ETA to calculated ETA
* Zoom with butons on the status bar (requested by tablet PC user)
* Use "timeout bar" to select first item on map click in crowded areas
* Show _DEL in Airport Information
* Get METAR direct from Airport Information
* See ToolTips on most buttons and objects
 fixed:
* Facilitytype for ATIS (VATSIM)
* Restore Docks correctly on window minimize/restore
* Allow to disable border lines by setting strength to 0px
* Show map labels of busy airports in favor of less busier ones
* Labels are less conservative in decluttering and use the screen better
* Show _FSS stations (by faking the facilityType which is not reported
  correctly in WhazzUp data for VATSIM)
* Preferences dialog fits on a 1280x800 screen
* Put data location in the program path (./data), not /usr/share on Unix,
  may be overridden through option general/dataDirectory as before
* Set Zoom In/Out to CTRL+/- as F11 got obscured on Linux and was not
  applicable on Mac as well
